Send cash first!\r\n\r\nThis is Release 5.x of Ian Darwin's (copyright but distributable)\r\nfile(1) command, an implementation of the Unix File(1) command.\r\nIt knows the 'magic number' of several thousands of file types.\r\nThis version is the standard \"file\" command for Linux,\r\n*BSD, and other systems. (See \"patchlevel.h\" for the exact release number).\r\n\r\nYou can download the latest version of file from:\r\n\r\n\tftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/\r\n\r\nA public read-only git repository is available at:\r\n\r\n\thttps://github.com/glensc/file\r\n\r\nThe major changes for 5.x are CDF file parsing, indirect magic, and\r\noverhaul in mime and ascii encoding handling.\r\n\r\nThe major feature of 4.x is the refactoring of the code into a library,\r\nand the re-write of the file command in terms of that library. The library\r\nitself, libmagic can be used by 3rd party programs that wish to identify\r\nfile types without having to fork() and exec() file. The prime contributor\r\nfor 4.0 was Mans Rullgard.\r\n\r\nUNIX is a trademark of UNIX System Laboratories.\r\n\r\nThe prime contributor to Release 3.8 was Guy Harris, who put in megachanges\r\nincluding byte-order independence.\r\n\r\nThe prime contributor to Release 3.0 was Christos Zoulas, who put\r\nin hundreds of lines of source code changes, including his own\r\nANSIfication of the code (I liked my own ANSIfication better, but\r\nhis (__P()) is the \"Berkeley standard\" way of doing it, and I wanted UCB\r\nto include the code...), his HP-like \"indirection\" (a feature of\r\nthe HP file command, I think), and his mods that finally got the\r\nuncompress (-z) mode finished and working.\r\n\r\nThis release has compiled in numerous environments; see PORTING\r\nfor a list and problems.\r\n\r\nThis fine freeware file(1) follows the USG (System V) model of the file\r\ncommand, rather than the Research (V7) version or the V7-derived 4.[23]\r\nBerkeley one. That is, the file /etc/magic contains much of the ritual\r\ninformation that is the source of this program's power. My version\r\nknows a little more magic (including tar archives) than System V; the\r\n/etc/magic parsing seems to be compatible with the (poorly documented)\r\nSystem V /etc/magic format (with one exception; see the man page).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the /etc/magic file is built from a subdirectory\r\nfor easier(?) maintenance.  I will act as a clearinghouse for\r\nmagic numbers assigned to all sorts of data files that\r\nare in reasonable circulation. Send your magic numbers,\r\nin magic(5) format please, to the maintainer, Christos Zoulas.\r\n\r\nCOPYING - read this first.\r\nREADME - read this second (you are currently reading this file).\r\nINSTALL - read on how to install\r\n\r\nsrc/apprentice.c - parses /etc/magic to learn magic\r\nsrc/apptype.c - used for OS/2 specific application type magic\r\nsrc/asprintf.c - replacement for OS's that don't have it.\r\nsrc/ascmagic.c - third & last set of tests, based on hardwired assumptions.\r\nsrc/asctime_r.c - for systems that don't have it.\r\nsrc/asprintf.c - for systems that don't have it.\r\nsrc/cdf.c - parser for Microsoft Compound Document Files\r\nsrc/cdf_time.c - time converter for CDF.\r\nsrc/compress.c - handles decompressing files to look inside.\r\nsrc/ctime_r.c - for systems that don't have it.\r\nsrc/encoding.c - handles unicode encodings\r\nsrc/file.c - the main program\r\nsrc/file.h - header file\r\nsrc/fsmagic.c - first set of tests the program runs, based on filesystem info\r\nsrc/funcs.c - utilility functions\r\nsrc/getopt_long.c - for systems that don't have it.\r\nsrc/getline.c - for systems that don't have it.\r\nsrc/is_tar.c, tar.h - knows about tarchives (courtesy John Gilmore).\r\nsrc/names.h - header file for ascmagic.c\r\nsrc/magic.c - the libmagic api\r\nsrc/print.c - print results, errors, warnings.\r\nsrc/readcdf.c - CDF wrapper.\r\nsrc/readelf.[ch] - Stand-alone elf parsing code.\r\nsrc/softmagic.c - 2nd set of tests, based on /etc/magic\r\nsrc/strlcat.c - for systems that don't have it.\r\nsrc/strlcpy.c - for systems that don't have it.\r\nsrc/vasprintf.c - for systems that don't have it.\r\ndoc/file.man - man page for the command\r\ndoc/magic.man - man page for the magic file, courtesy Guy Harris.\r\n\tInstall as magic.4 on USG and magic.5 on V7 or Berkeley; cf Makefile.\r\nMagdir - directory of /etc/magic pieces\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you submit a new magic entry please make sure you read the following\r\nguidelines:\r\n\r\n- Initial match is preferably at least 32 bits long, and is a _unique_ match\r\n- If this is not feasible, use additional check\r\n- Match of <= 16 bits are not accepted\r\n- Delay printing string as much as possible, don't print output too early\r\n- Avoid printf arbitrary byte as string, which can be a source of\r\n  crash and buffer overflow\r\n\r\n- Provide complete information with entry:\r\n  * One line short summary\r\n  * Optional long description\r\n  * File extension, if applicable\r\n  * Full name and contact method (for discussion when entry has problem)\r\n  * Further reference, such as documentation of format\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nParts of this software were developed at SoftQuad Inc., developers\r\nof SGML/HTML/XML publishing software, in Toronto, Canada.\r\nSoftQuad was swallowed up by Corel in 2002 and does not exist any longer.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
