<p>Phone: Do not even think of telephoning me about this program. Send cash first!</p>

<p>This is Release 5.x of Ian Darwin's (copyright but distributable)
file(1) command, an implementation of the Unix File(1) command.
It knows the 'magic number' of several thousands of file types.
This version is the standard "file" command for Linux,
*BSD, and other systems. (See "patchlevel.h" for the exact release number).</p>

<p>You can download the latest version of file from:</p>

<pre><code>ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/
</code></pre>

<p>A public read-only git repository is available at:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/glensc/file
</code></pre>

<p>The major changes for 5.x are CDF file parsing, indirect magic, and
overhaul in mime and ascii encoding handling.</p>

<p>The major feature of 4.x is the refactoring of the code into a library,
and the re-write of the file command in terms of that library. The library
itself, libmagic can be used by 3rd party programs that wish to identify
file types without having to fork() and exec() file. The prime contributor
for 4.0 was Mans Rullgard.</p>

<p>UNIX is a trademark of UNIX System Laboratories.</p>

<p>The prime contributor to Release 3.8 was Guy Harris, who put in megachanges
including byte-order independence.</p>

<p>The prime contributor to Release 3.0 was Christos Zoulas, who put
in hundreds of lines of source code changes, including his own
ANSIfication of the code (I liked my own ANSIfication better, but
his (__P()) is the "Berkeley standard" way of doing it, and I wanted UCB
to include the code...), his HP-like "indirection" (a feature of
the HP file command, I think), and his mods that finally got the
uncompress (-z) mode finished and working.</p>

<p>This release has compiled in numerous environments; see PORTING
for a list and problems.</p>

<p>This fine freeware file(1) follows the USG (System V) model of the file
command, rather than the Research (V7) version or the V7-derived 4.[23]
Berkeley one. That is, the file /etc/magic contains much of the ritual
information that is the source of this program's power. My version
knows a little more magic (including tar archives) than System V; the
/etc/magic parsing seems to be compatible with the (poorly documented)
System V /etc/magic format (with one exception; see the man page).</p>

<p>In addition, the /etc/magic file is built from a subdirectory
for easier(?) maintenance.  I will act as a clearinghouse for
magic numbers assigned to all sorts of data files that
are in reasonable circulation. Send your magic numbers,
in magic(5) format please, to the maintainer, Christos Zoulas.</p>

<p>If you submit a new magic entry please make sure you read the following
guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial match is preferably at least 32 bits long, and is a <em>unique</em> match</li>
<li>If this is not feasible, use additional check</li>
<li>Match of &lt;= 16 bits are not accepted</li>
<li>Delay printing string as much as possible, don't print output too early</li>
<li><p>Avoid printf arbitrary byte as string, which can be a source of
crash and buffer overflow</p></li>
<li>
<p>Provide complete information with entry:</p>

<ul>
<li>One line short summary</li>
<li>Optional long description</li>
<li>File extension, if applicable</li>
<li>Full name and contact method (for discussion when entry has problem)</li>
<li>Further reference, such as documentation of format</li>
</ul>
